        "question": "What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?",
        "answer": "The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages."

        "question": "React vs. Angular vs. Vue?",
        "answer": "There are three frameworks for building web applications that every frontend developer has heard about: React, Vue.js, and Angular. React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework, while Vue.js is a progressive framework. They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but theyâ€™re not 100 percent the same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences. Each framework is component-based and allows the rapid creation of UI features."
